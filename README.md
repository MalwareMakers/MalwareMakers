### Hi, This is MalwareMakers - Nice to meet you. 

## A bit about me: 

1. I'm currently working on a malware script to update the existing one: [here](https://github.com/MalwareMakers/Python-Botnet).
2. I'm starting a youtube channel to walk through installations and process of my software, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZuObhKspH3D58Hir8-Lbg).
3. I'm looking to collaborate on new software amongst other things.

# Youtube? 
You might find it surprising that someone with just one repository is starting a YouTube channel. However, I'm committed to expanding my GitHub presence with more interesting and useful scripts in the future. The YouTube channel will primarily focus on installation walkthroughs. If you're interested, consider subscribing to the channel and sharing the content. The more people who engage, the more content and software I'll be able to create.
### Looking to talk:
